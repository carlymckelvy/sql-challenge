# sql-challenge

As a new data engineer for Pewlett Hackard, I was tasked with analyzing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s.  The data provided to me was in the form of CSVs.  To analyze this data, I first created an ERD (as shown below) using genmymodel, which helped to visualize the relationships between the various datasets.  This program created the initial table schema that was copied into pgAdmin, where the tables were created, including foreign keys.  Once tables were created, I proceeded to create several queries in order to provide the requested analyses, which are included in the EmployeesSQL folder.
